      <h3>Nick Andrei Trivino</h3>
      <p> Hello everyone, I'm a filipino student at City, studying Computer Science with Cyber Security MSCi.
          In terms of programming I have a moderate amount of experience with it, in particular
          when it comes to games, as it was part of my coursework for A levels in which we made a game
          with python. A few of my personal interests are simply coding, gaming, and most of all food ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°). </p>

    <h3>Programming With Java: City Game Coursework</h3>
    <p>
	For my Java coursework I was tasked with creating a game utilising city-engine, a physics engine designed
        by City, University of London. The concept I went for was a simple platformer game in which the player would need
        need to carefully navigate around each level, and avoid numerous bodies such as enemies and spikes and even false
        hearts.
